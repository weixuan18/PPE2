   It has been described as Afghanistan’s brain drain, after the Taliban’s
   return to power last year precipitated an exodus of politicians,
   academics and journalists who fled in anticipation of reprisals and
   censorship under the militant group’s draconian regime.

   For a small group of Afghan women, however, the work of running the
   country has not stopped, even in exile.

   Fawzia Koofi is a former member of Afghanistan’s parliament and was its
   first female deputy speaker. Despite moving several times since leaving
   the country in August last year, the 47-year-old has kept talking with
   her former colleagues and contacts in international governance, working
   to find solutions to the political and humanitarian crisis in
   Afghanistan.

   “They [the Taliban] don’t know how to govern and they don’t respect the
   social mosaic of Afghanistan, which makes them more fragile, but is
   also hurting Afghans,” says Koofi, who has been working in Europe and
   the US with member states across the UN for the past year. “I don’t
   believe they will last very long, but I am concerned over the damage
   they inflict on Afghanistan’s social and political fabric.”

   The work of Koofi and fellow Afghan women has helped to fill the gulf
   that exists between the Taliban, which are operating under severe
   sanctions and are domestically consumed with an economic crisis and
   enforcing gender apartheid, and the international community.

   “We call them the ‘group of six’,” says Sarah Douglas, of UN Women,
   referring to a core group of Afghan women who have been instrumental in
   steering international policy towards their country over the past year.
   The group also includes Asila Wardak, a former diplomat and one of the
   founders of the Afghan Women’s Network; Sofia Ramyar, the former
   executive director of the youth-led organisation Afghans for
   Progressive Thinking; and the journalist Anisa Shaheed.

   Giving an example, Douglas says: “There were negotiations around the
   mandate renewal of the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan (Unama) –
   and concerns that the mandate would regress in terms of gender equality
   and human rights, and that this would be reflected in the budget. But
   the mandate remained intact, and central member states actually reached
   out to me and said that the advocacy by these women really made a
   difference in those negotiations.”

   and Development Studies

   Mariken Bruusgaard Harbitz, part of the permanent mission of Norway to
   the UN, says: “Norway initiated closed-door dialogues for these women
   to present their priorities to key member states at a critical time.
   During the process of renewing Unama’s mandate, these women came with
   clear expectations to the wording of the mandate, which in turn
   contributed to a strong monitoring and reporting mechanism for Unama on
   the ground.”

   Mariam Safi, director of the Afghan Organisation for Policy Research
   and Development Studies, has not allowed the chaos and shock of the
   last year to stop her continuing her work from Canada, collecting
   crucial data from Afghanistan, specifically from women. After a brief
   hiatus, Safi improvised and restarted her work a few months ago through
   a digital platform, with female researchers across Canada and
   Afghanistan working from home.

   One of their key projects, called Bishnaw, which means “listen” in
   Dari, continues to hold surveys with women across Afghanistan. “There’s
   a narrative [in the media] right now that says Afghans are
   predominantly concerned with the humanitarian crisis,” says Safi. “But
   our data from women across nine provinces shows that right after that,
   women are most concerned about women’s rights and closure of girls’
   schools.”

   Bishnaw’s surveys have also revealed a pattern of women being excluded
   from receiving international aid. “Of about 295 women, 163 told us that
   no women in their household had access to aid, contrary to the Taliban
   claims that women-led households were being provided aid. Only about
   five women out of 532 surveyed said all women have access at all.”

   “Such data can actually provide [the international community] with a
   lot more leverage in their discussions with the Taliban,” she says. “In
   every meeting they are always asking, ‘What do Afghans want? What do
   women want? What are their concerns?’ We want to be able to provide
   data to answer those questions,” she says.

   Naheed Farid, one of the youngest Afghan parliamentarians when she was
   elected at 27, describes her work with the group of six as reviving her
   sense of mission after she left Kabul for the US last year. “I had lost
   all hope after the Taliban takeover. But watching Afghan women and
   youth marching across Kabul, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif and Jalalabad
   demanding for their rights gave me the strength to reignite my
   advocacy,” she says.

   Douglas says there is a danger of international focus drifting away
   from Afghanistan without the efforts of these women and others like
   them. “My assessment is that they are being extremely bold because they
   want to keep the momentum and the visibility, and the issue of Afghan
   women, high on the agenda. And especially with the situation in
   Ukraine, they’re very concerned that the international community is
   forgetting about that.”

   One member state whom she highlights for their continued commitment to
   working with the group is Ireland. Their outgoing ambassador to the UN,
   Geraldine Byrne Nason, says: “With my team, I meet with them on roughly
   a monthly basis. We cover the latest developments in Afghanistan as
   they affect ordinary people, and women in particular. I keep them
   abreast of developments at the UN and in particular, at the security
   council. I seek their views on the issues of the day as they relate to
   the council’s work on Afghanistan. We exchange views on how to use our
   respective leverage to make a difference.”

   “Discussions of and decisions on peace and security in a conference
   room in midtown Manhattan can only be effective if they are informed by
   the voices of those directly impacted,” says Byrne.
