   In his first feature-length documentary released in 2011, The Imam and
   I, Cape Town-based filmmaker Khalid Shamis, 46, told the story of his
   maternal grandfather Imam Abdullah Haron. A prominent anti-apartheid
   activist and cleric, the imam was murdered by the South African
   Police’s notorious Security Branch while in detention.

   The filmmaker’s next venture is a similar ode to a family political
   drama, but this time it is about his father, the political activist and
   journalist Ashur Shamis, 72. Its title, The Colonel’s Stray Dogs, is
   taken from a statement by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 1980 giving
   orders to eliminate all the country’s “stray dogs” – exiles living
   abroad – and telling them to either return or face “physical
   liquidation”.

   Shamis’ father was one of these so-called stray dogs, and the
   documentary provides a deeply personal window into the tragedy of Libya
   by interrogating his life-long sacrifice against the backdrop of his
   life, and that of his family, in exile. It is being screened at the
   Durban International Film Festival until 1 August.

   While deeply political, the story is also profoundly personal. Shamis’
   central question is about his father’s commitment to his family versus
   his dedication to the struggle for freedom, and the cost of that. “My
   dad opposed Gaddafi for most of his life,” Shamis says in the film’s
   opening lines. “For the 40 years he was in exile in England, it felt
   like killing Gaddafi was more important to him than living with us.”

   Through a decade of research, laboriously digging through archives and
   doing interviews, he stitches together a remarkable story. His part in
   it starts in London in the United Kingdom, where he was born to his
   Libyan father and South African mother Shamela, who had left her home
   country when she was 18, escaping the apartheid regime who would kill
   her father a year later. The couple met, married and started a family.

   Shamis says his youth was relatively normal considering the
   extraordinary circumstances of his parents’ background. About Libya, he
   says, he was “always curious and a bit intrepid”. In London the family
   always discussed Cape Town, he explains, whereas “Libya was always this
   unknowable place. It was very closed, and it was all about the cult of
   Gaddafi.”

   Shamis left London for South Africa in 2005 to make The Imam and I. He
   ended up staying, raising his own family.

Tracing history

   Gaddafi rose to power in the late 1960s through a military coup in
   Libya and ruled for 40 years until his death. Ashur had become
   politicised during the 1960s while still living in Libya, but left for
   London in 1965 to pursue his studies as an aeronautical engineer. Owing
   to his criticism of the government, Ashur’s name was added to a target
   list in the early 1970s and he was unable to return to home.

   Many Libyan political dissidents were forced abroad at the time. Ashur
   hid his political life from his family in order to protect them. At one
   point, he was declared an enemy of the Libyan state with a $1 million
   bounty on his head. Meanwhile, he predominantly worked to promote the
   resistance movement abroad and became central as a media liaison and,
   later, a journalist working for the BBC World Service.

   While in exile, Ashur joined members of the London-based National Front
   for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), which was formed in 1981 with the
   core focus of creating a democratic Islamic society. Its members
   conducted a series of military actions in the 1980s against Gaddafi,
   including a failed coup attempt. Though the NFSL was the core
   opposition to Gaddafi’s regime, it is known to have had ties to
   America’s Central Intelligence Agency in maintaining its covert
   operations abroad.

   years, he was shown on television in silhouette as he was targeted by

   Some of Shamis’ earliest memories of his father are seeing his
   silhouetted figure appearing on the evening television news. Ashur
   became a political commentator on news from Libya but his face was
   always hidden. He had several near-fatal experiences as he covertly
   tried to spur on the revolution.

   Shamis says he did not know much about his father’s activities. “I knew
   my dad was in opposition to Gaddafi. I knew that he was on [an]
   Interpol [list] – at one point there was a bounty on his head. I knew
   growing up that he had all these passports, I’d seen them. But the
   details I didn’t know… What opened this up for me was realising he had
   all of these documents under his desk, in suitcases.”

   The full extent of Ashur’s involvement in the NFSL only unfolded for
   Shamis through making the film. It is summed up humorously when he says
   to his father: “While we were in the other room watching Rambo, you
   were in this room planning Rambo.”

A stranger in his country

   Gaddafi’s fall from grace was a messy one. It was not only Libyan
   rebels and youths who joined forces to end his regime. A North Atlantic
   Treaty Organization intervention that was widely criticised lasted
   seven months and raised a death toll of about 8 000 people.

   When Gaddafi’s rule came to a bloody end in 2011, Shamis mainly wanted
   to document his father’s return home after 40 years. “When the
   revolution started, I thought if there’s a chance my dad’s going to go
   back, I want to make a film about it. I knew the main points of the
   history. I wanted to know more about what he did and to see what
   happens when he goes back.”

   But he came to realise that he would have to explore both the
   relationship between Ashur and the dictator and that between father and
   son, and so he would have to feature in it too. “And from that point I
   thought okay, it has to really be me in it. I have to not just tell his
   story but tell my story of his story.”
   Undated: Father and son Ashur and Khalid Shamis together in a still
   from The Colonel’s Stray Dogs. They spent many years sifting through
   suitcases full of documents that carry nearly 40 years of Libyan
   political history.

   Ashur left for Libya as an adviser to the government once Gaddafi was
   chased out of Tripoli only to find it a vastly different place to the
   one he had left. Shamis and the rest of the family visited a few months
   later. “By the time we arrived in Libya, Gaddafi was dead and it was a
   new place,” he says of the country he had heard about his entire life
   but visited only once.

   The revolution once imagined did not happen and the freedom dreams held
   for Libya were not actualised. The country was deeply fractured, many
   returning exiles were marginalised and the government continued to
   remain unstable – a situation that remains to this day and is often
   referred to as the “Libyan crisis”. Ashur, despondent and unable to
   find himself a place among the new ideals of Libya, chose to return to
   London, where he continues to live.

Building blocks

   The Colonel’s Stray Dogs has an excellent score by Shamis’ close
   friend, the film producer and composer Tiago Correia-Paulo. But much of
   its brilliance lies in the selection of powerful archival material – an
   impressive array of cassettes, VHS tapes, secret documents, passports,
   letters, books, photos and combat footage from Libya – all of which had
   been preserved by Ashur.

   “Anything to do with Libya, he recorded it,” says Shamis. “Or anything
   to do with what’s been happening in the Middle East, such as the
   Iranian Revolution. He’s got old tape recorders and newspapers… He
   would send us out to get all the newspapers. He would cut them up.”
   Circa 1984: Ashur Shamis, his wife Shamela and their sons during a
   family dinner at a restaurant in London.

   Shamis would often be the one to press “record” on the tapes. “Whenever
   anything happened with Libya, my dad was the go-to guy,” he says. “He
   would go for the interview and he’d call us on those phones with the
   curly wire and say, ‘Khalid, at 10 o’clock tonight, press record on the
   VHS machine. Find the tape, put it in and just record.”

   The first thing Shamis did when starting work on the film was to gather
   all the material and digitise what would become his main source for
   constructing the story. “The archives is a big thing,” he says, and it
   was an arduous and expensive process to obtain the rights for using
   some of the material.

A personal take

   Gaddafi was a complex and divisive figure – some thought of him as a
   dictator and renegade madman, whereas others saw him as a
   pan-Africanist and anti-imperialist who supported the liberation
   movements of many African countries. But as Shamis says: “He wasn’t
   that to us. He tried to kill us.”

   He adds: “On the one hand, he was the new handsome face of the
   socialist Left, but he became this dictator to his own people. He
   talked about wanting to unite Africa, but he wanted to rule Africa as
   well.”

   Two months after Gaddafi’s announcement about capturing “stray dogs”,
   Libyan agents shot dead BBC journalist Mohammed Mustafa Ramadan, a
   friend of Ashur’s, outside the Regent’s Park mosque in London. “There
   are Libyan families we grew up with whose dads were assassinated,” says
   Shamis, “and they suffered. But we survived and we kept together. And
   my dad’s alive. I think I should have talked about them more somehow
   [in the film], but it’s also not my story to tell.”
   Circa 1982: Old photographs of Ashur Shamis that were taken at the
   height of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya’s operations in
   London.

   Having two activist paternal figures has influenced Shamis to use his
   filmmaking as a medium for deeply personal takes on political art. Both
   his documentaries have revealed important moments in history that were
   previously undocumented, especially from the unique perspective of
   exile.

   To his credit as a filmmaker, Shamis is able to convey the story from
   within, without missing a beat. He has captured the family’s life in
   London, sometimes approaching the interviews more as an investigative
   journalist than a son, unafraid to ask both his parents difficult
   questions. Particularly interesting is the interview with Shamela, an
   incredibly strong woman and, as the daughter of Imam Haron and Ashur’s
   wife, the holder of many secrets.

   Initially, there is a distance between father and son as the interviews
   take place, but their relationship changes as the film progresses.
   “That’s what I got out of it,” says Shamis. “I think, knowing what he
   gave up and sacrificed and what he was going towards, I never really
   questioned before what that was.”

   Shamis says as the making of The Colonel’s Stray Dogs progressed, his
   father would often refer to it as “our film” and ask fondly: “How’s our
   film coming along?” He regrets not being able to watch its premiere at
   the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival in April with
   Ashur, owing to Covid-19 travel restrictions. “My big dream was to be
   in the cinema and watch it with him, but it didn’t happen.” When his
   father did get to see the film, “he didn’t expect this personal story,
   but it got his stamp of approval”.
   Undated: A still image from The Colonel’s Stray Dogs showing fragments
   of a double life. Ashur Shamis carried multiple passports and had
   different code names in order to remain underground and protect his
   family.

   Wrapping the film in March after so many years of working on it was a
   “great feeling”, says Shamis. “I was ready to let it go. It’s a big
   weight off your shoulders, because over these years it’s always
   there.”

   Shamis’ unconventional approach to telling his father’s story paints a
   fragile journey in heroic mode. Ultimately, it is a tragic story about
   the dream for freedom and its personal costs – one to which many exiles
   around the world can relate.
