   exile

about us

   Due to war, racial, ethnic, sexual and gender discrimination, or
   religious, economic and political marginalization, every day many
   people are forced to leave their homeland. Amongst them, some are
   artists often involved in a continuous fight against the authorities of
   their countries. Since it is the duty of art to be the voice of the
   oppressed and to reveal the underlying issues in the society, the
   creative sector in Europe must be particularly mindful of the matter
   and provide
   the infrastructures to better accommodate these artists. Artists must
   be able to continue to practice their art, not only as individuals, but
   also as custodians of their culture. It is through art that the culture
   of a people whose autonomy is threatened, will continue to live on.

   The mission of the agency of artists in exile (aa-e) is to identify
   artists in exile of all origins and disciplines, to support them
   according to their situation and needs, to offer them work space and to
   put them in contact with professionals (French and European networks),
   in order to provide them with the necessary means to restructure and
   continue their practice. According to the demands of project and
   programs, the aa-e creates its own events, including the “Party in
   exile” and the multidisciplinary festival, Visions of Exile, in
   cooperation with its partners.

our mission

a dedicated space for the aa-e at 6 rue d’Aboukir 75002 Paris

   The agency of artists in exile proposes:
     * a reception and advisory office where artists are individually
       received and where their needs are identified;
     * a convivial space where artists can spend time, have the use of
       computers with internet access, meet in small numbers and arrange
       appointments;
     * spaces for artistic practice where artists can come to work
       occasionally or in the form of residencies punctuated by
       presentations by professionals, or workshops on artistic practice
       for an amateur public.
