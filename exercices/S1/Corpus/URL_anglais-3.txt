   Moscow’s chief rabbi, Pinchas Goldschmidt, is “in exile” after
   resisting Kremlin pressure to support the war in Ukraine, his
   daughter-in-law has said.

   Goldschmidt, who also heads the Conference of European Rabbis, left
   Russia just weeks after it launched its invasion of Ukraine, saying he
   had to take care of his ailing father in Jerusalem.

   But this week his daughter-in-law revealed that Goldschmidt and his
   wife had also been put under official pressure to support the war and
   now considered themselves to be in exile because of their opposition to
   what Russia has called its “special military operation”.

   “Can finally share that my in-laws, Moscow chief rabbi [Pinchas
   Goldschmidt] & Rebbetzin Dara Goldschmidt, have been put under pressure
   by authorities to publicly support the ‘special operation’ in Ukraine –
   and refused,” Avital Chizhik-Goldschmidt, a journalist who is married
   to Goldschmidt’s son, Benjamin, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday evening.

   Goldschmidt has been Moscow’s chief rabbi since 1993 and is one of the
   most influential Jewish leaders in Russia. If the account is confirmed,
   Goldschmidt would be a rare high-profile religious leader to leave
   Russia due to opposition to the war. The Orthodox bishop, Patriarch
   Kirill, and other religious leaders in Russia have voiced support of
   the war.

   The Guardian has written to Goldschmidt and Chizhik-Goldschmidt for
   comment.

   “They are now in exile from the community they loved, built and raised
   their children in over 33 years,” Chizhik-Goldschmidt wrote, describing
   a journey that took her parents-in-law through Hungary and then eastern
   Europe, where she said they had helped fundraising efforts for
   Ukrainian refugees.

   He went on to Jerusalem, where his father had been in hospital.

   “The pain & fear in our family the last few months is beyond words,”
   she said. “The sounds of the Moscow Choral Synagogue ring in our ears …
   I’ll never forget our engagement there in ‘14, & taking our children
   there, Shavuos ‘18… Grateful our parents are safe; worried sick over
   many others …”

   Demographers estimate there are about 150,000 Jewish people in Russia.

   Goldschmidt was reelected on Tuesday to another seven-year term as the
   chief rabbi of Moscow and the leader of the Moscow Choral Synagogue,
   one of Russia’s most storied houses of worship. He had remained in his
   post while outside the country, delegating authority to a deputy in his
   absence.

   His reelection was supported by a number of senior Israeli rabbis, who
   had asked that “no change be made in the composition of the rabbinate
   and the tribunal without coordination with us”. Another conservative
   religious leader in Israel warned that “we have been witnessing a
   difficult reality when governments try to interfere in the tenure of
   rabbis”.

   There were also reports of government pressure to replace Goldschmidt
   in the elections. “The coup attempt failed,” a source in the Russian
   Jewish community told the Jerusalem Post.

   Goldschmidt had previously told Israel’s Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper
   that he did “not define myself as an exiled rabbi, I am a rabbi who is
   not living in his community”.

   But at an opening ceremony for the Conference of European Rabbis in
   Munich last week, Goldschmidt was accompanied by several German
   bodyguards while he delivered a speech attacking the war.

   “We have to pray for peace and for the end of this terrible war,” he
   said. “We have to pray that this war will end soon and not escalate
   into a nuclear conflict that can destroy humanity.”
