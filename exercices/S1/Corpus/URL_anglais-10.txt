Russian journalist says he intuitively knew Putin was a 'bloody man'

   Exiled Russia journalist Andrei Loshak describes the state of Russia's
   future, while encouraging Russians to avoid supporting anything in
   favor of the Ukrainian war.

   "At the beginning, the graffiti used to say 'F--- Russia' or 'F---
   Putin,' but now it says 'F--- Russians.' It's unpleasant, of course,"
   Russian journalist Andrei Loshak says.

   He is one of the thousands of Russians who fled to neighboring Georgia
   in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine and around the time that Russia
   criminalized independent war reporting.

   Graffiti aside, Loshak says he is fond of Georgia and relishes that,
   from there, he can say and write what he chooses. He tries to be
   philosophical about all the inconveniences associated with fleeing
   one's country in a heartbeat and having credit cards that are pretty
   much useless anywhere outside of Russia and the reality that he won't
   be able to go home anytime soon.

   The bigger issue, he says, is the incredible malaise about the war and
   what it is doing to his world, his cousins, his neighbors.

   "My soul aches a lot. It aches for Ukraine. It is not a foreign
   country, not an abstract Syria, which is also terrible," Loshak
   says. "War is terrible. But Ukraine is also my native country, my
   native land.  My father was born in Kharkiv, and my grandfather was
   born in Odesa. As a child, I spent every summer in Odesa. All of this
   is sheer pain."

   UKRAINE WARNS MOSCOW IS RUNNING ‘PARALLEL’ EVACUATION ROUTES FROM
   MARIUPOL INTO RUSSIA

   The former Soviet republic of Georgia is famous for its festive tables
   forever groaning with food and local wine, but Loshak says none of his
   compatriot exiles are much in the mood for all that.

   "I haven't watched a single TV series or movie since the war began,
   although I used to watch a lot. And when my Netflix account was shut
   down because I could no longer pay for it, I didn't even notice,"
   Loshak said. "Thousands of people have written to me that they have the
   same condition. You open up Telegram feeds in the morning, and you're
   immersed in this hell, and you can't stop."

   Loshak says one shouldn't hide from this condition, calling it his and
   Russians' "punishment, collective responsibility at least knowing what
   they're doing and what's going on there."

   The pandemic was probably good practice for the independent journalists
   in Russia who now need to do much of their work remotely. It is not
   easy, but many say they are determined to keep at it, countering the
   state propaganda in whatever way they can.

   Loshak is working on a documentary about how many families are fighting
   and splitting and no longer on speaking terms over differing opinions
   of the war. This is causing a big rift in Russian society.  Loshak,
   like many, never believed the war would actually happen.

   Asked when he came to understand just what Russian President Putin was
   capable of, Loshak says it was when explosions in four apartment blocks
   around Russia went off, killing hundreds in the early fall of 1999.

   The Kremlin attributed it to Chechen terrorists. To this day, many
   suspect the hand of the FSB behind those deadly bombings, creating a
   justification for Moscow to invade Chechnya.

   "He never seemed kind to me," Loshak says of Putin. "I actively
   disliked him from 1999, even though I was 26 at the time and wasn't
   interested in politics. But I felt something immediately in my bones
   ... his background, the way he looked, the KGB.

   ZELENSKYY WARNS RUSSIA WILL LIKELY INVADE OTHER COUNTRIES IF SUCCESSFUL
   IN UKRAINE

   "When the terrorist attacks began, on the wave of which he started the
   second Chechen war, intuitively I got the feeling this was a very dirty
   game. And from that moment, I had the feeling he was quite a bloody
   man," Loshak says.

   At some point, he says, that was forgotten and Putin just seemed a
   pragmatic, rational man who would keep Russia in a sort of gray area.

   "But then," Loshak adds, "there was this Dima Yakovlev law."

   The law was drawn up in 2012 in retaliation for the Magnitsky Act being
   passed in Congress.

   The Magnitsky Act called for sanctions on people deemed "human rights
   abusers" in the aftermath of the death of Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian
   jail. It was a death the Russians tried to sweep under the table.

   Dima Yakovlev was a Russian orphan who died at the hands of his
   adoptive U.S. parents after being left in a parked car for nine
   hours. So the Russian retaliatory logic was that no Americans should
   adopt Russian children because they could not be trusted to protect
   them. A rather asymmetrical tit-for-tat, many, including Loshak, say.

   "It was difficult to punish Americans economically, but it was possible
   to do this," Loshak said. "It was total insanity. I don't understand
   how these people are made if they sacrifice children to punish some
   American families."

   Loshak feels Russia has gotten to the point where "it lives in the head
   of an elderly KGB officer with outdated ideas about the world, his
   complexes and so on … the whole country finds itself in this kind of
   insane matrix."

   Asked what Russians seeking change can do now, in the current
   situation, Loshak said, "I don't have an answer right now. I can't say,
   'Guys, come out to rallies' because it makes no sense now. And, anyway,
   I lost this moral authority when I left the country."

   He believes nothing short of hundreds of thousands of people pouring
   onto the streets will force the Russian authorities to stand up and
   listen. But that's not going to happen, according to many observers,
   because people are afraid.

   "There's no point in calling for political activism right now. Perhaps
   we should remember the manifesto (Alexander) Solzhenitsyn wrote in the
   1970s — 'Live Not By Lies,' about how to remain a decent person under
   the conditions of a totalitarian state. You must try not to cooperate
   with it," he says.

   "Do not take money from the state as far as that is possible. Don't owe
   it anything."

   He tells his friends making the hard decision to stay or go to leave.
   "Save your soul," Loshak said, adding Russia "is sliding toward real
   fascism as a form of government."
